Algorithm: MapReduce for Calculating Average

1. Map Phase:
   - Read each line from the input file.
   - For each line:
     - Split the line into subject and points.
     - Emit (subject, points) as key-value pairs.

2. Reduce Phase:
   - For each key (subject):
     - Initialize sum and count to 0.
     - For each value (points) associated with the key:
       - Add points to sum.
       - Increment count.
     - Calculate average = sum / count.
     - Emit (subject, average).

Pseudo-code:

Map Function:

map(line, output):
    tokens = split line by comma
    if tokens.length == 2:
        subject = tokens[0].trim()
        points = parse tokens[1] as double
        output.put(subject, points)


Reduce Function:

reduce(input):
    sum = new HashMap<String, Double>()
    count = new HashMap<String, Integer>()

    for each entry in input:
        subject = entry.getKey()
        points = entry.getValue()

        sum[subject] += points
        count[subject] += 1

    for each entry in sum:
        subject = entry.getKey()
        totalPoints = entry.getValue()
        totalCount = count[subject]
        average = totalPoints / totalCount
        print("Subject: " + subject + ", Average Points: " + average)


Main:

main():
    input = new HashMap<String, Double>()

    open input.csv file
    for each line in input.csv:
        map(line, input)

    reduce(input)
